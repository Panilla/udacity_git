What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It creates the repository so that you can start making commits, and/or keep track of untracked files. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is where you start to add files to the next commit, your working directory has the last saved version of these files, and your repository is where each version of a commit is saved. The staging area gives you a lot of freedom as to which files you want to include in a commit, and the files added just sit there until you actually make the commit to the repository.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
Use 'git diff' without any arguments to see what changes have been made so far between the working directory and the staging area. You can also use 'git diff --staged' to see differences between the staging area and the last commit that was made. 


What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?
Branches are helpful when you want to experiment with some code, but don't want it to affect your main files that you use regularly. It's also helpful if you want to save versions in different languages. 

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

the diagram the way we do?
