What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It creates the repository so that you can start making commits, and/or keep track of untracked files. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is where you start to add files to the next commit, your working directory has the last saved version of these files, and your repository is where each version of a commit is saved. The staging area gives you a lot of freedom as to which files you want to include in a commit, and the files added just sit there until you actually make the commit to the repository.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
